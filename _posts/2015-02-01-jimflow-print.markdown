# Jimflow Print
JimFlow Print is part of the [JimFlow project](http://jimflow.jimdo.com/), which helps digitizing kanban boards.  
JimFlow Print enables everyone in a company or office to print tickets and notes (currently) on A6 format, using [Google Cloud Print API](https://developers.google.com/cloud-print/) for managing (Epson) printers and print jobs. No need for hours-long printer setups.

Used Technologies:  

*   Symfony 2
*   Google Cloud Print API (for printing Tickets)
*   Ansible (for setting up local development environment)
